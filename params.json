{"name":"Zoom Bukkit Plugin","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","google":"","body":"# About\r\nZoom is a simple bukkit plugin that allows you to zoom in and out when you left/right (configurable) click with a configureable object in your hand. I got the idea from hawkfalkon's wonderful plugin http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/vertigo/ .\r\ncomp500 added a Telescope item for it!\r\n\r\n# What? Explain.\r\nThis is best explained in a few images (note: this shows the max zoom level. There are others in between):\r\n\r\nNo zoom:\r\n![](http://dev.bukkit.org/media/images/49/53/flowers.png)\r\nFull zoom:\r\n![](http://dev.bukkit.org/media/images/49/54/flowers_zoom.png)\r\nNo zoom:\r\n![](http://dev.bukkit.org/media/images/49/52/squid.png)\r\nFull zoom:\r\n![](http://dev.bukkit.org/media/images/49/51/squid_zoom.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, cool, why do my players need it?\r\nWell, it is useful for you and your players to spy on each other, or shoot each other with arrows. It is a great addition to any pvp minecraft server.\r\n\r\n# Permissions\r\ncomp added them: \r\n  Zoom.*:\r\n    description: Gives access to all Zoom commands\r\n    default: true\r\n    children:\r\n      Zoom.zoom: true\r\n      Zoom.command: true\r\n  Zoom.zoom:\r\n    description: Allows you to zoom in.\r\n    default: true\r\n  Zoom.command:\r\n    description: Allows you to spawn the zoomer with a command.\r\n    default: op\r\n\r\n# How to use and configure.\r\nHold the magic item (that you set in the config file) and left/right click (again, based on what you set in the config file).\r\n\r\nThe configuration file has 2 values:\r\n\r\nMouse_Button : Left or right, depending if you want to left or right click to zoom in. DEFAULT: right\r\nMagicItem : The item that must be in your hand to zoom in. DEFAULT: telescope\r\n\r\n# Installation and Download\r\n## Installation\r\nSimply put the .jar file in your plugins directory in Bukkit!\r\n## Download\r\nVersion 2 (latest release): [z2.0.jar](http://comp500.github.com/Zoom-Plugin/z2.0.jar)\r\n\r\n# Support\r\nI have been pretty busy lately, but if you have a problem, or find a bug, email me at jtjj222@live.ca, or pm me on the bukkit forums. My username is jtjj222. If there is a feature you really want though, why not implement it yourself and make a pull request? :D\r\n\r\n# How to build\r\nJust import the sources into your ide. In eclipse, place the source code into your workspace, then create a new project with the same name as the source code folder. Add bukkit (1.3+) to your build path, and everything should work!\r\n\r\n# How to update the code\r\nMake a pull request. No feature is too small, and no question is stupid :D\r\n","tagline":""}
